Hello, I am Gaelle Huart, an Integrator developer passionate about the connection between web design and efficiency.

Formerly a painter/illustrator, I discovered web development through an OpenClassrooms course, where I realized that my artistic eye and technical logic are a powerful duo.

I am proficient in React, JavaScript and Sass, with particular expertise in design and interactivity, developed from the very beginning of my learning curve.

My approach combines Agile methodology and great attention to detail, because I believe that elegant code and perfect UX should walk hand in hand.

My goal is to specialize in Python and contribute to the architecture of scalable solutions while developing my own projects.
