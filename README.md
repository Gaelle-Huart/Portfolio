# Portfolio

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. I had fun with it. Thanks a lot!

## About

This protfolio showcases the projects I worked on. It is meant to evolve over time, just like myself, thanks to the projects I plan to make in the future.

## Sections

### Hero

This part of the website is meant to present myself. It explains in a few sentences what are my motivations and goals in regard to code and programming languages in general. I decided to present it with buttons to avoid having a wall of text as a first impression. Like this, the user can read the information if he is interested and if not, he can simply bypass it. I think it's a good compromise between too much and not enough.

### Projects

As anyone would expect, this section is where my projects are presented to the visitor. My goals here were to make something esthetical and enjoyable for the user. UI, UX and design were the main focus. Also, I find modals incredibly fun to make and to use. Not only that but they are also neat solutions when something needs to have more info and you don't want to dump it all in a massive block. In this case, said block would repeat itself many times. It would lead to an info overload, in my opinion. I went with clean, design and modals!

### Skills

This section is short, some would even say concise, and repertories the skills I have learned so far. I decided to present it by using icons, not only with aesthetics in mind but also for efficiency purpose. In order to make it a bit more visitor friendly, there is an info bubble naming the technology/skill when the cursor stay over it.

### Record

Here, I made a simplified version of my CV. It's short and I hope it's practical enough to make it an interesting addition to my protfolio. I did my best to make it as original as I could, while making it as legible as possible. Its purpose is to deliver the info quickly, not confuse anyone.

### Contact

There is no need to reinvent the wheel so this section is pretty common. That said, it's also a proven solution so it had to be on my website. I made it as efficient as I could again. Simplicity and efficacity are both important to me, alongside design.

## Improvments

I will keep on working on my website from now on, so I'm already thinking of making some tweaks in the future that could improve it some. For example, I could work the touch interactions for the mobile version. I could include a feature allowing the user to download my full CV. Or I could add one that give access to my full contact info. Add an illustrative picture in the Hero. A banner ? Well, many ideas are never too far from my brain so, we'll see!
